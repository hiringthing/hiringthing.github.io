You can visit https://hiringthing.github.io/iframe_test_harness to test an arbitrary page in an iframe.

Pass the url you want to test as the `iframe_src` param like so: `https://hiringthing.github.io/iframe_test_harness?iframe_src=https://arrow-technologies.prismhr-hire.com`.  Note that this tool only supports our private labels that allow iframing.
